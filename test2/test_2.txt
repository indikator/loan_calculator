1. For to know the execute time of each function we can wrap this function to next construction:
$timeStart = microtime(true);
# HERE IS INVESTIGATED FUNCTION
$timeEnd = microtime(true);
$time = $timeEnd - $timeStart;
echo "Function XXX has been executed $time seconds.";

2. From my experience - the most cases of increase execution time is:
a) open (and maybe not close) database connection and/or file resources inside loops.
The time spent for opening connection/resource extremely more than work with it.
b) deep loops. 3 and more level. Each level is increase time of executing exponentially.
c) unneeded check. For exaple - if (false & false & true) will check each sentence,
while if (false && false && true) will check only first.
